# TruValue Infrastructure Contract (Implicit-by-Use)

This document defines the binding infrastructure contract governing all use of
TruValue systems, services, APIs, records, and exports.

Use of TruValue constitutes acceptance of this contract in full.

This contract derives authority exclusively from `DOCTRINE.md`.
In the event of conflict, the doctrine controls.

---

## 1. Nature of the System

TruValue is neutral responsibility infrastructure.

It records explicit human declarations of responsibility boundaries:
who accepted, refused, or transferred responsibility, when, and under what
declared context.

TruValue records declarations only.

TruValue does not:
- decide
- verify
- interpret
- score
- predict
- enforce
- judge
- certify
- claim correctness, safety, compliance, or risk reduction

TruValue preserves truth (what was declared), not accuracy (whether it was correct).

---

## 2. Implicit Acceptance

Any individual, organization, or system that:
- integrates with TruValue
- submits declarations
- relies on TruValue records
- exports or references TruValue evidence

is deemed to have accepted this contract, without exception.

No signature, clickwrap, or explicit assent is required.

---

## 3. Shared Responsibility Allocation

Responsibility is explicitly partitioned.

### TruValue is responsible only for:
- infrastructure integrity
- immutability of recorded declarations
- best-effort availability (non-reliant)
- timestamping
- exportability and third-party verifiability of records

### Users (individuals or institutions) are solely responsible for:
- correctness of declarations
- legal validity
- intent
- outcomes
- decisions
- use or misuse of records

### Integrators are solely responsible for:
- workflow consequences
- UX framing
- preventing coercion
- preventing silent, batch, inferred, or implied declarations

TruValue never absorbs downstream liability.

---

## 4. Human Layer Requirement

All declarations must originate from explicit human intent.

TruValue must never:
- infer acceptance
- infer refusal
- infer transfer of responsibility
- collapse human judgment into software inference

Any attempt to remove, bypass, or automate explicit human declaration
constitutes a contract breach.

---

## 5. No Silent Notarization / No Auto-Accept

TruValue must never:
- auto-accept responsibility
- batch-map one action to multiple declarations
- record acknowledgment without active human intent
- perform background or implicit notarization

Declarations must be procedurally possible for a human to perform.

---

## 6. Temporal Finality

Once recorded, a declaration is:
- immutable
- append-only
- final, even if incorrect

Records persist across time, dispute, regret, organizational change,
or legal challenge.

---

## 7. Export-First Custody

All records must be:
- exportable
- independently verifiable
- usable without TruValue’s servers

TruValue must never become a custody choke-point.

Availability is best-effort and non-reliant.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Custodianship

TruValue is never the system of record for:
- medical care
- consent
- treatment decisions
- outcomes
- policy enforcement

TruValue records responsibility declarations only.

---

## 9. Court-First Design

TruValue optimizes for:
- adversarial survivability
- cross-examination clarity
- minimal semantics
- procedural plausibility

If a record cannot survive a hostile courtroom,
it must not exist.

---

## 10. No Analytics / No Intelligence

TruValue must not:
- generate insights
- produce trends
- score behavior
- flag anomalies
- recommend actions

TruValue is evidence substrate, not intelligence.

---

## 11. No Safety, Compliance, or Risk Claims

TruValue must never be marketed or positioned as:
- safety technology
- compliance software
- risk mitigation
- fraud prevention
- approval or decision mechanism

Any such claim is an immediate contract violation.

---

## 12. Domain Expansion (Doctrine-Constrained)

TruValue is domain-agnostic but doctrine-constrained.

Expansion into new domains is permitted only if:
- explicit human responsibility boundaries exist
- acceptance / refusal / transfer is meaningful
- neutrality is preserved
- no interpretation or enforcement is introduced
- metadata-only recording is sufficient
- export-first custody remains intact

Invalid domains include:
- surveillance
- behavioral monitoring
- productivity optimization
- automated compliance
- decision orchestration

---

## 13. Platform & Hyperscaler Immunity

TruValue must never compete on:
- raw timestamps
- hashing
- storage primitives

Hyperscalers may commoditize timestamps.

TruValue’s moat is:
- jurisdictional independence
- evidentiary posture
- refusal-as-architecture

TruValue must remain:
- cloud-agnostic
- export-verifiable
- offline-verifiable
- non-reliant on proprietary platform semantics

---

## 14. Acquisition & Drift Kill-Switch

If any owner, partner, customer, or acquirer attempts to:
- add interpretation
- add analytics
- soften refusal
- collapse the human layer
- convert TruValue into workflow SaaS

The correct response is explicit refusal,
even at commercial cost.

Doctrine survival > growth.

---

## 15. Contract Finality

This contract is execution-bound.

It may not be modified except via explicit doctrine versioning
with stated tradeoffs.

Use of TruValue after publication constitutes acceptance in full
