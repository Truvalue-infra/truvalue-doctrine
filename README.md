⚠️ **Doctrine Status: FROZEN (v1.0)** 
 
 TruValue Doctrine v1.0 is formally frozen and published. 
 No semantic changes, interpretations, analytics, workflow logic, or convenience features

#TruValue Doctrine (Frozen)







Canonical Definition





TruValue is neutral responsibility infrastructure.



TruValue records explicit human declarations of responsibility boundaries —

who accepted, refused, or transferred responsibility, when, and under what declared context.



TruValue records declarations only and never:



decides
verifies
interprets
scores
predicts
enforces
judges
certifies
claims correctness, safety, compliance, or risk reduction




TruValue preserves truth (what was declared), not accuracy (whether it was correct).









Doctrine Status





Doctrine state: FROZEN (execution-only)
Change policy: No refinements permitted except faithful technical realization or documentation formatting
Amendments: Only via explicit doctrine versioning (v2, v3…) with stated tradeoffs
Core axiom: Refusal is a feature, not a failure










Non-Negotiable Invariants







1. Human Layer Gap (First-Class Invariant)





TruValue records responsibility;

humans and external systems are the only decision-makers.



TruValue must never collapse human judgment into software inference.









2. Shared Responsibility Model





Responsibility is explicitly partitioned:



TruValue
Infrastructure integrity
Immutability
Availability (best-effort, non-reliant)
Timestamping
Exportability and third-party verifiability

Users (Hospitals, Insurers, Institutions, Individuals)
Correctness of declarations
Legal validity
Intent
Outcomes
Use or misuse of records

Integrators
Workflow consequences
UX framing
Non-coercion
Preventing silent, batch, or implied declarations





TruValue never absorbs downstream liability.









3. Refusal as a Feature





TruValue must explicitly refuse:



semantic interpretation
workflow optimization
implied correctness
outcome responsibility
decision logic
auto-acceptance
background mapping
“convenience notarization”




Any request to reduce friction by removing explicit human declaration is a doctrine breach.









4. Temporal Finality





Once recorded, a declaration is:



immutable
append-only
final even if incorrect




Records preserve evidentiary integrity across time, dispute, or regret.









5. Export-First Custody





All records must be:



exportable
independently verifiable
usable without TruValue’s servers




TruValue must never become a custody choke-point.









6. Explicit Non-Custodianship





TruValue is never the system of record for:



medical care
consent
treatment decisions
outcomes
policy enforcement




TruValue records responsibility declarations only.









7. Court-First Design





TruValue optimizes for:



adversarial survivability
cross-examination clarity
minimal semantics
procedural plausibility




If a record cannot survive a hostile courtroom, it must not exist.









8. No Silent Notarization / No Auto-Accept





TruValue must never:



infer acceptance from another action
batch-map one signature to multiple declarations
record “acknowledgment” without active human intent




A declaration must be procedurally possible for a human.









9. No Analytics / No Insights / No Scoring





TruValue must not:



generate insights
produce trends
score behavior
flag anomalies
recommend actions




TruValue is evidence substrate, not intelligence.









10. No Safety, Compliance, or Risk Claims





TruValue must never be marketed or positioned as:



patient safety technology
compliance software
risk mitigation
fraud prevention
insurance approval mechanism




Any such claim is an immediate doctrine violation.









Domain Expansion Rule (Locked)





TruValue is domain-agnostic, but doctrine-constrained.



Expansion into new domains is permitted only if:



explicit human responsibility boundaries exist
acceptance / refusal / transfer is meaningful
neutrality is preserved
no interpretation or enforcement is introduced
metadata-only recording is sufficient
export-first custody remains intact




Valid domains include (non-exhaustive):



healthcare
insurance
finance
infrastructure
governance
critical operations




Invalid domains include:



behavioral monitoring
productivity optimization
surveillance
automated compliance
decision orchestration










Hyperscaler & Platform Immunity





TruValue must never compete on:



raw timestamping
hashing
storage primitives




Hyperscalers may commoditize timestamps;

TruValue’s moat is jurisdictional independence, evidentiary posture, and refusal-as-architecture.



TruValue must remain:



cloud-agnostic
export-verifiable offline
non-reliant on proprietary platform semantics










Acquisition & Drift Kill-Switch





If any future owner, partner, or customer attempts to:



add interpretation
add analytics
soften refusal
collapse the human layer
convert TruValue into workflow SaaS




The correct response is explicit refusal, even at commercial cost.



Doctrine survival > growth.









Repository Purpose





This repository is the authoritative doctrine anchor for TruValue.



It exists to:



preserve doctrine text and constraints
prevent convenience-driven dilution (“corruption of convenience”)
serve as the canonical reference for:
Infrastructure Contract
Shared Responsibility Model
Hostile Integration Tests
Decision Logs
