# TruValue Doctrine (Frozen)

## Canonical Definition

TruValue is neutral responsibility infrastructure.

TruValue records explicit human declarations of responsibility boundaries —
who accepted, refused, or transferred responsibility, when, and under what declared context.

TruValue records declarations only and never:
decides, verifies, interprets, scores, predicts, enforces, judges, certifies, or claims correctness, safety, compliance, or risk reduction.

TruValue preserves truth (what was declared), not accuracy (whether it was correct).

---

## Doctrine Status

Doctrine state: FROZEN (execution-only)

Change policy:
No refinements permitted except faithful technical realization or documentation formatting.
Amendments are allowed only via explicit doctrine versioning (v2, v3…) with stated tradeoffs.

Core axiom:
Refusal is a feature, not a failure.

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

### 1. Human Layer Gap (First-Class Invariant)

TruValue records responsibility.
Humans and external systems are the only decision-makers.

TruValue must never collapse human judgment into software inference.

---

### 2. Shared Responsibility Model

Responsibility is explicitly partitioned:

**TruValue**
- Infrastructure integrity
- Immutability
- Availability (best-effort, non-reliant)
- Timestamping
- Exportability
- Third-party verifiability

**Users (Hospitals, Insurers, Institutions, Individuals)**
- Correctness of declarations
- Legal validity
- Intent
- Outcomes
- Use or misuse of records

**Integrators**
- Workflow consequences
- UX framing
- Non-coercion
- Preventing silent, batch, or implied declarations

TruValue never absorbs downstream liability.

---

### 3. Refusal as a Feature

TruValue must explicitly refuse:
- Semantic interpretation
- Workflow optimization
- Implied correctness
- Outcome responsibility
- Decision logic
- Auto-acceptance
- Background mapping
- “Convenience notarization”

Any request to reduce friction by removing explicit human declaration is a doctrine breach.

---

### 4. Temporal Finality

Once recorded, a declaration is:
- Immutable
- Append-only
- Final, even if incorrect

Records preserve evidentiary integrity across time, dispute, or regret.

---

### 5. Export-First Custody

All records must be:
- Exportable
- Independently verifiable
- Usable without TruValue servers

TruValue must never become a custody choke-point.

---

### 6. Explicit Non-Custodianship

TruValue is never the system of record for:
- Medical care
- Consent
- Treatment decisions
- Outcomes
- Policy enforcement

TruValue records responsibility declarations only.

---

### 7. Court-First Design

TruValue optimizes for:
- Adversarial survivability
- Cross-examination clarity
- Minimal semantics
- Procedural plausibility

If a record cannot survive a hostile courtroom, it must not exist.

---

### 8. No Silent Notarization / No Auto-Accept

TruValue must never:
- Infer acceptance from another action
- Batch-map one signature to multiple declarations
- Record “acknowledgement” without active human intent

A declaration must be procedurally possible for a human.

---

### 9. No Analytics / No Insights / No Scoring

TruValue must not:
- Generate insights
- Produce trends
- Score behavior
- Flag anomalies
- Recommend actions

TruValue is evidence substrate, not intelligence.

---

### 10. No Safety, Compliance, or Risk Claims

TruValue must never be marketed or positioned as:
- Patient safety technology
- Compliance software
- Risk mitigation system
- Fraud prevention tool
- Insurance approval mechanism

Any such claim is an immediate doctrine violation.

---

## Domain Expansion Rule (Locked)

TruValue is domain-agnostic, but doctrine-constrained.

Expansion into new domains is permitted only if:
- Explicit human responsibility boundaries exist
- Acceptance / refusal / transfer is meaningful
- Neutrality is preserved
- No interpretation or enforcement is introduced
- Metadata-only recording is sufficient
- Export-first custody remains intact

Valid domains include (non-exhaustive):
- Healthcare
- Insurance
- Finance
- Infrastructure
- Governance
- Critical operations

Invalid domains include:
- Behavioral monitoring
- Productivity optimization
- Surveillance
- Automated compliance
- Decision orchestration

---

## Hyperscaler & Platform Immunity

TruValue must never compete on:
- Raw timestamping
- Hashing
- Storage primitives

Hyperscalers may commoditize timestamps.

TruValue’s moat is:
- Jurisdictional independence
- Evidentiary posture
- Refusal-as-architecture

TruValue must remain:
- Cloud-agnostic
- Export-verifiable
- Offline-checkable
- Non-reliant on proprietary platform semantics

---

## Acquisition & Drift Kill-Switch

If any future owner, partner, or customer attempts to:
- Add interpretation
- Add analytics
- Soften refusal
- Collapse the human layer
- Convert TruValue into workflow SaaS

The correct response is explicit refusal, even at commercial cost.

Doctrine survival > growth
