# TruValue Decision Log (Frozen Doctrine)

This log records doctrine-consistent decisions only.
It is not a roadmap. It is an evidence trail.

Rules:
- Every entry is timestamped.
- Every entry cites the doctrine invariant(s) it relies on.
- Every entry states: Decision, Reason, Outcome.
- If doctrine is challenged, the default outcome is REFUSAL.
- Doctrine survival > growth.

Template (copy for every entry):

## YYYY-MM-DD — <Decision Title>
**Context:** <one paragraph>
**Decision:** <Approved / Rejected / Deferred>
**Doctrine basis:** <Invariant #s, clause names>
**Reason:** <why>
**Outcome:** <what happens next>
**Notes:** <optional>
